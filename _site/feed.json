			"content_html": "<p>Hulu Live TV appears to be much better than YouTube TV. However, they are continuing the trend of TV apps that emphasize content over channel surfing. Those used to old TV paradigms may therefore find the app hard to navigate. That’s my first impression – more thoughts soon. </p>\n",

Note that local multiplayer isn’t great – the controls were clearly built for d-pad, and playing with a control stick (Pro Controller or single Joy-Con) leads to lots of frustrating accidental input. </p>\n",
