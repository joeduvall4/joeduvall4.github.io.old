PSA: SMS wasn’t made to be secure, and [cell carriers are terrible with security](https://medium.com/@CodyBrown/how-to-lose-8k-worth-of-bitcoin-in-15-minutes-with-verizon-and-coinbase-com-ba75fb8d0bac)! Don’t use SMS for login. Question companies that require it. 

Cell carriers: step up your security game.
Service providers: allow Google Authenticator instead of SMS. 
It’s 2017. This stuff matters.
