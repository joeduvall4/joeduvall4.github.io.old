PSA: If the automatic app updates feature of iOS seems like it doesn’t actually update all your apps, [Phased Releases](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/879732149376737280) could be part of the reason why! 

Nothing wrong with phased releases, and it’s good that users can manually update. But the implementation here isn’t great. Having an app take up to 7 days to auto-update makes the entire auto-update feature feel unreliable and broken. 

As far as I can tell, the update shows up in your update queue, but sits there for up to 7 days or until manually applied. Not ideal.

But, App Store improvements are always welcome! Based on Apple’s recent actions, I’m hopeful that this feature will be improved over time. 👍
